# Position-dependent-coin-operators
This repo contains the implementation of the naive and the linear-depth quantum circuit presented in this paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05271.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05271). They allow the implementation of a position-dependent coin operator for a discrete-time quantum walk.
