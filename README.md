# Position-dependent-coin-operators
This repository contains the implementation of the naive and the linear-depth quantum circuit presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05271, and the adjustable-depth from https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10460. They allow the implementation of a position-dependent coin operator for discrete-time quantum walks on a ring.
